Please fork this project into your personal account and commit your changes on the fork. Give us the URL of your fork, so we can review your work. Thank you!

Please check the following missions and solve them:

## Mission #1

Check App.tsx. There's a thing which can be improved.

## Mission #2

Test the behaviour of the app properly.

## Mission #3

The App should display an unstyled unordered list of items above the counter. The list of items must be fetched from a backend. The backend is not ready yet but the work on the frontend must already start. Find a solution to mock the response data from the backend without needing to change too many things once the backend implementation is in place.

The JSON structure looks like the following:
```
[
  {
    id: 1,
    label: 'Some label 1'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    label: 'Some label 2'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    label: 'Some label 3'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    label: 'Some label 4'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    label: 'Some label 5'
  }
]
```

## Mission #4

Add type annotations in a meaningful way, if you not already did it.
