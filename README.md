Please check the following missions and solve them:

## Mission #1

Check App.tsx. There's a thing which can be improved.

## Mission #2


## Mission #3

It must be possible to query a list of items from the backend. The backend is not ready yet but the work on the frontend must already start. Find a solution to mock the response data from the backend without needing to change too many things once the backend implementation is in place.
The items must be displayed in an unstyled unordered list.

The JSON structure looks like the following:
```
[
  {
    id: 1,
    label: 'Some label 1'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    label: 'Some label 2'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    label: 'Some label 3'
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    label: 'Some label 4'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    label: 'Some label 5'
  }
]
```
